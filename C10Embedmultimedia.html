<p> Family has been, and always will be, something that is very important to me. In five years, the only thing that I am sure of is ensuring that I have the best relationship poissble with my sister, brother, parents, and of course my dogs. My sister lives in London, and I have a strong appeal to live in London for a year or two. I would love to have the chance to be in London as a young 20 year old living near my sister.</strong></p>

<h2> London is one of my favorite cities! </h2>

  <p> Five years from now I hope to be finishing my last year of law school. My top choices for where I want to attend law school are UVA, Northwestern, or Georgetown. My plan is to goto law school two years after I graduate from Washington and Lee, but who knows, anythingis possible. The only thing that is constant in life is family.<br>
